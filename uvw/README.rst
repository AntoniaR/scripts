Calculate UVW position of a baseline
====================================
John Swinbank, November 2012
----------------------------

Calculates the uvw position corresponding to a particular baseline assuming we
are looking at the zenith.  This is a demo which takes no arguments -- change
the positions of the antennae by editing the script. Positions are ITRF2005.

Extending the script to cover pointings other than the zenith is left as an
exercise for the reader!

Requires ``pyrap``.
