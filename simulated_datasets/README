2 scripts used to create and analyse simulated datasets.

simulate.py
This script creates a large number of simulated datasets using 20 LBA MSSS observations of the field of 3C295. All parameters are hardcoded into the script, so will require editing prior to use.
A report on this script is available here:
http://www.lofar.org/operations/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=tkp:trap_simulated_datasets.pdf
Run by typing: python simulate.py

TraP_autorun.py
This will take all of the simulated datasets (of a particular lightcurve type) and conduct the following:
1. Run TraP on all datasets (separately). Uses the CASA images output by simulate.py.
2. Extract data from database for each dataset
3. Compare to the expected skymodel
4. Create plots of total flux and flux ratio for each dataset
5. Create plots of transient parameters and conduct machine learning.
All parameters are hardcoded into the script. Requirements:
1. Needs running on heastro1
2. Numpy, matplotlib, mlpy, etc (see imports at start of file)
3. dump_transient_runcat.py (hardcoded to copy in my home directory, but available on github here: https://github.com/timstaley/tkp-user-config/blob/master/extras/dump_trans_runcat.py)
A report will be available in the future. Takes ~3-4 days to run on one full set of simulated datasets.
Run by typing: python TraP_autorun.py
