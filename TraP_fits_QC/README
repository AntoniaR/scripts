Usage: python TraP_fits_QC.py <sigmaClip> <sigmaRej> <f> <frequencies>

Script updated for TraP Release 2 databases. If using TraP Release 1.1 please use older version.

Requirements:
os, glob, sys, numpy, pyfits, math, datetime, scipy, matplotlib, tkp
tools.py, getRMS.py
Access to TraP databases via dump_image_data_v1.py

Instructions:

1. Move to the directory containing all the fits files you want to process (it automatically uses every fits file in the current working directory)
2. Run this script: 
    python TraP_fits_QC.py <sigmaClip> <sigmaRej> <f> <frequencies>

    <sigmaClip>       : The clipping value for RMS calculation (equivalent to sigma in the TraP job_params.cfg file) 
    <sigmaRej>	      : The sigma used for rejection of images. The RMS values are fitted with a Gaussian and all images that are >sigmaRej sigma away from the mean are rejected. 
    <f>	              : The subsection of the image used for calculating the RMS (as in the TraP job_params.cfg file)
    <frequencies>     : "T"/"F" - do you want to fit all the frequencies together or separately

   In the working folder, a number of png images are output which show an overview of your images. Additionally, a file "images_to_process.py" is output which can be used with TraP to only process the good images.
   

Feedback on this script is welcome, please post comments and issues on github.
