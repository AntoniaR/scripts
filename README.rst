LOFAR TKP Script Archive
========================

This repository contains a collection of assorted scripts written by TKP
members for manipulating LOFAR data. Members are encouraged to add any
scripts they write which might be of interest to others.

Please place any new scripts in a directory which should include the
script plus any supporting files. Also add a (brief!) "README" file
describing what the script does and any instructions for running it, and
update the listing below.
