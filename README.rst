LOFAR TKP Script Archive
========================

This repository contains a collection of assorted scripts written by TKP
members for manipulating LOFAR data. Members are encouraged to add any
scripts they write which might be of interest to others.

Please place any new scripts in a directory which should include the
script plus any supporting files. Also add a (brief!) "README" file
describing what the script does and any instructions for running it, and
update the listing below.

    Scripts used to create and analyse simulated datasets.

`TraP_QC_diagnostics <https://github.com/transientskp/scripts/tree/master/TraP_QC_diagnosticss>`_
    A script that uses TraP outputs analyse the quality of images and outputs the recommended QC settings for TraP.

`TraP_QC_plots <https://github.com/transientskp/scripts/tree/master/TraP_QC_plots>`_
    Creates a variety of plots to give an overview of the quality of a given dataset for TraP.

`TraP_source_overview <https://github.com/transientskp/scripts/tree/master/TraP_QC_plots>`_
    Creates plots of the transient parameters for all sources in a dataset.

`uvw <https://github.com/transientskp/scripts/tree/master/uvw>`_
    Calculate the UVW coordinates of a given baseline.
