Usage: python Tidy_Mosaic.py

Requirements:
os, glob, numpy

Instructions:
Go to the directory containing your Mosaic images and run:

python Tidy_Mosaic.py

It inserts the required metadata for the TraP tools to use. Then you need to run tkp-inject.py (http://docs.transientskp.org/tkp/r1.1/tools/tkp-inject.html) to insert the correct metadata for the LOFAR quality control steps.
