Usage: python TraP_source_overview.py <database> <dataset_id> <Release>

Requirements:
os, glob, sys, numpy, datetime, coords, math, matplotlib
Access to TraP databases

Instructions:

1. Run TraP on your restored.corr images and force it to treat all sources as transient (in transientsearch.parset set all thresholds=0 and minpoints=1). Note the database you are using and the dataset_id for entry later.
2. Create a folder to run this script in.
3. You are now ready to run this script. Go to ${your_working_folder} and run: 
   python TraP_source_overview.py <database> <dataset_id> <release>
   The release is the version of the pipeline that you are running.
   In the working folder, a number of png images are output which show an overview of your dataset. Further information about these plots will be given on the LOFAR wiki pages soon.
   Additionally, it will write out all the data to a file called trans_data.txt

Feedback on this script is welcome, please e-mail: b.a.rowlinson@uva.nl

WARNING - This script currently does not work for Release 1 databases. This will be corrected in the near future.
