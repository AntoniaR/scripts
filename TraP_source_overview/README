Usage: python TraP_source_overview.py <database> <dataset_id> <Release> <sigma> <plt_all> <plt_freqs>

Requirements:
os, glob, sys, numpy, datetime, coords, math, matplotlib
Access to TraP databases

Instructions:

1. Run TraP on your restored.corr images and force it to treat all sources as transient (in transientsearch.parset set all thresholds=0 and minpoints=1). Note the database you are using and the dataset_id for entry later.
2. Create a folder to run this script in.
3. You are now ready to run this script. Go to ${your_working_folder} and run: 
   python TraP_source_overview.py <database> <dataset_id> <release> <sigma> <plt_all> <plt_freqs>
   The release is the version of the pipeline that you are running.
   In the working folder, a number of png images are output which show an overview of your dataset. Further information about these plots will be given on the LOFAR wiki pages soon. Additionally, it will fit the eta_nu and V_nu values with a Gaussian distribution (in log space) and determine the transient search cut values using the number sigma multiplied by the standard deviation of the fitted Gaussian distribution.
   plt_all = T gives all the transient sources, whereas F gives the sources only present in the first day of observations (RSM only)
   plt_freqs = T produces all the plots in specific frequencies, whereas F only gives the total plots (colour coded by frequency).
   Additionally, it will write out all the data to a file called trans_data.txt

If you are not running this script on heastro1, you will need to edit dump_transient_runcat_v1.py to point to your database.
