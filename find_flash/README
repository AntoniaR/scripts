This script finds new sources (not in skymodel) and identifies sources which are much brighter than expected given the skymodel. It also produces plots which compare extracted sources to the skymodel sources.

Usage:
./find_flash.sh *.fits

Requires a parset file called find_flash.parset with 
"""
search_radius=10 # the radius used in gsm.py
flux_limit=0.5 # the minimum flux used in gsm.py
flux_ratio=5 # minimum flux ratio to identify flaring source
systematic_error=10 # position systematic error (in arcsec)
PYSE_detection=8 # PYSE detection threshold
PYSE_analysis=3 # PYSE analysis threshold
PYSE_grid=50 # PYSE background grid size
PYSE_margin=0 # PYSE source extraction margin
PYSE_radius=200 # PYSE source extration radius
"""

Only works on CEP1, requires PYSE, gsm.py, find_flash_script.py and assoc_trans.py

Can now also identify all unique transient sources and create a ds9 region file - recommend loading this in ds9 and overplotting the NVSS catalogue to confirm new sources.
